## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting patient features
- Heart disease prediction based on input features
- Probability score displayed with prediction
- Feature contribution analysis using SHAP for interpretability
- Responsive design for various devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask, Joblib, SHAP, Scikit-learn
- **Database**: None (currently uses in-memory processing)
- **API**: RESTful API for predictions
- **Hosting**: Local environment (Flask for backend, Vercel for frontend)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- A local or virtual environment for Python

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vaniahchristian/Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-System.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-System/backend

2. **Install required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py

4. **Frontend Setup**
    
   ```bash
   cd ../heart-diagnosis-frontend


5. **Install required Node.js packages:**

   ```bash
     npm install
6. **Start the React development server:**
   ```bash

   npm start


7. **How to Run the Application**

Ensure both the backend and frontend servers are running.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Fill out the form with the required patient features and click "Predict".

The application displays the prediction result, probability, and feature contributions.

8. **How the Model Works**
The heart disease prediction model is built through the following steps:

Preprocessing: Normalization and encoding of categorical variables.

Model Training: The model is trained with a supervised learning algorithm ( Logistic Regression).

Model Evaluation: Evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Predictions: Input features are scaled using the pre-trained scaler and passed to the model for prediction.

Interpretability: SHAP values are calculated to understand which features influenced the prediction most. 

These values are displayed to the user.
